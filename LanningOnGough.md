##Remarks on the dedication of the Helson-Gough Library at the Institute of Personality and Social Research

----------

Thank you for the opportunity to come back to Berkeley, and to think about and talk about Ravenna Helson and Harrison Gough. 

I worked closely with Harrison in the early and mid 1980s. I remember that, following an IPAR assessment or perhaps a class on the blind interpretation of the MMPI or CPI, Harrison would encourage us to begin by considering whether we liked a particular person or profile. So let me begin by saying that I loved Harrison, without ambivalence, and that I learned far more from him than I can possibly share here. 

###Helson, Gough, Block, and the founders
I want to begin with a few pictures, which are taken from Ravenna Helson and Jack Block's autobiographical chapters in the *Journal of Personality Assessment.* Each has listed the date as 'early 1970s' - but the date was in fact April 16, 1983. It was Harrison who pointed out to me that the pictures were taken at my wedding to Carol.

I begin with the pictures in part because they are dashing and beautiful, in part out of narcissism (they put Carol and I at the Copernican center of things), but also because they help with an analogy. The personality program here at Berkeley in the 1980s, and at IPAR in particular, was a place like no other. But the epoch was, in some respects, less unique.  

Jack Block was sharp, Ravenna deep, and Harrison broad, and in this they echoed the founders of personality psychology fifty years before. Jack Block embraced and arguably identified with the brilliant Kurt Lewin. Ravenna channeled Henry Murray, for, like Murray, Helson addresses rather than avoids the deeper strata of consciousness. The result is an intellectual honesty and courage in Ravenna's work which stands apart from most of contemporary personality and social psychology.  In their life paths, of course, Ravenna and Murray faced altogether different cultural challenges, and I think dealt with them in very different ways; Ravenna's story, to me, appears one of triumph.

###On Harrison Gough and Gordon Allport##

Harrison Gough, with his breadth and sensibility, his scholarship and responsibility, his trait words and his radical individuality was the foundation, the leader, our Gordon Allport.  The analogy to Allport is more compelling and more telling if we consider Harrison's place alongside those with whom he is most typically compared,  Hans Eysenck (author of the *EPQ*) and Ray Cattell (the *16PF*). Both Eysenck and Cattell, in their particular interpretations of science and social interest, were drawn towards a eugenic agenda that makes many of us cringe. But Harrison, despite his work in population psychology, never went down that path. 

In Gough's worldview, as in that of Allport, there is no tension between social justice and good science. Human nature is inherently multidimensional, and human communities are inherently interdependent. Given this, any attempt to reduce people to a single dimension of human value is not just distasteful, but bad science.  

What Harrison saw, and we strive to see, is the strength of the individual person, the necessity of individual differences for a functioning community. This approach is embodied in Gough's *California Psychological Inventory* (in which four types, equally valuable, are assessed, and in which interpreters are asked to interpret profiles in terms of their strengths), and was embodied, too, in Gough's interactions with faculty and students. 

Regarding his interactions with faculty, Harrison served as psychology department chair at Berkeley in the 1960s, at the epicenter of social change and social tension; years later, he told me that although he served out of a sense of duty, it helped him appreciate the good work of his colleagues.  (A few years later, I would leave Berkeley with the expectation that this is what chairs, deans, and provosts were like; sadly, I have yet to serve under or with a single administrator who embodied this). 

Regarding his interactions with students, I will just say that Harrison saw the best in me, too, and that without him I would not have been able to finish my degree.
 
Let me turn back to Allport. Some of you may know that in 1962, Harrison reviewed Allport's *Pattern and Growth in Personality,* which Harrison considered as a second edition of Allport's 1937 classic. I remember reading that review and being struck by the fact that Harrison counted the number and nature of references in the two books and used a number of other quantitative fallbacks in the way that he engaged the text. 

I will do something similar with Harrison's work here, in part  because it is right for me to step back from sentiment and speculation to hard data. In doing this, I apply some of the new tools of Big Data analysis; as Shelly Zedeck and Chris Maslach (2014) correctly point out in their *American Psychologist* obituary, these methods are a natural extension of Gough's empiricism. 

###On empiricism and clinical insight

Before my own empiricism I need to comment on Harrison's. Some have suggested that there is a tension between Harrison's empiricism, particularly in the CPI, and his clinical insight in understanding and characterizing the individual case. I think that these can be reconciled by appreciating that Harrison's was an empiricism in the philosophical as well as psychological sense. He embraced sense data, in both his perceptiveness and empathy and, too, in his measurement (as in his Perceptual Acuity Test). His motor ability to describe colleagues with anecdote, physicality, and his cornet-playing lips was wonderful (I can still remember, for example, his description of Kenneth Spence and his henchmen going from suite to suite at conferences, looking for parties), a behavioral analogue to his unequalled insight in writing personality test items. Perhaps the essence of Gough's psychology is his finely-tuned skill in perceiving and conveying the diagnostic sign, the meaningful individual difference.

## Four phases in the work of H. G. Gough: A differential text analysis

Big Data can be used to illuminate the study of lives in many ways, and ethical concerns about data today echo legal concerns about personality assessment and privacy going back at least to the 1960s. Here, I want to use text analysis - simple counts of words - to illuminate or at least illustrate different phases in a single life. (Email me if you are interested in the methods, which are available in an R markdown file).

What I've done is taken the text of some of Harrison's most important papers and separate them into four periods. I total the frequency of words within each of these corpora, then use word clouds to illustrate differences between each occasion and the complement. There are a number of limitations of the approach. It is essentially ipsative, and canâ€™t represent continuing themes in his life (e.g., creativity, social maturity).  Further, the choice of papers is somewhat arbitrary.
So, despite being data-based, this should be considered as impressionistic as the rest of my comments.  

Nevertheless.

The first phase, represented by papers in the 1940s and 1950s, reflects Harrison's shift from his undergraduate work in sociology (*sociological, role*) to his graduate work in clinical psychology (*patient, nervous, disease*)and, with the move to Berkeley, to personality psychology and authorship of the CPI(*personality, handbook*).

The second phase includes his key papers on socialization and conceptual analysis.  In this phase, the work is increasingly psychological (*delinquency -> socialization*) and reflective, considering why and what one measures in personality scales (*measurement, information, theoretical, continuous, conception, progression, critical*).

A third phase includes his Meehl-inspired paper on "Some reflections on the meaning of psychodiagnosis." It is in some ways a synthesis of his earlier work in clinical psychology with the papers on measurement, with terms such as *diagnosis, psychologist, tools, causes, therapy, interpretation,* and *interesting.* There is, here, a continuing interest in population psychology and applied issues as well, including men's willingness to use oral contraceptives (*children, male*).

The fourth phase includes his most important papers of the 1980s and 1990s, a time when much of his energy was devoted to a series of revisions of the CPI. This phases is distinguished by words related to measurement and in particular statistics, such as *sd, correlation, psychometric, statistically, * and *factor*.

I think that this can be read in several ways. Perhaps this reflects the greater meticulousness or obsessiveness of contemporary journals, perhaps one could argue that statistics were the pinnacle or culmination of Harrison's work.  

An alternative interpretation is that in Harrison's life, *measurement comes after psychology.*  (I am reminded in this of Loevinger's position, which I paraphrase here, as "psychometrics is the handmaiden of psychological theory.") 

Although this is an oversimplification, I think that it is closer to the truth (or rather *a* truth). With his life's progression from social role to clinical insight, from consequential behavior to latent construct, there is an increasing depth and richness to Harrison's psychology. In the last phase, the theoretical depth now justifies increasing sophistication in measurement. This interpretation runs exactly counter to the caricature of Gough's work and the Minnesota tradition as brute-force empiricism. 

Perhaps Harrison would have liked that.
